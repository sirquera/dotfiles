## Welcome!

This platform contains all the exercises you'll cover during your training at [Le Wagon, the French innovative Coding School](http://www.lewagon.com), welcome aboard!

## General overview

Our program has 7 modules:

1. **Setup**: a small module of 1 day (the first one) to setup your workstation.

2. **Ruby**: learn fundamental concepts shared by all programming languages: variables, methods, loops, conditional statements, iterators, regular expressions, file parsing, etc. Work on cool challenges with your buddies & practice on real-life examples (playing with APIs, scraping HTML, storing data in CSV files).

3. **OOP**: learn the basics of [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). You'll learn to structure your programs with objects and build your first MVC apps.

4. **Database & Active Record**: Understand persistence with relational databases. Learn SQL and connect Ruby objects using Active Record, the ORM used in Rails.

5. **Front-end**: Learn HTML, CSS, layout techniques, animations, and use libraries like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Get into JavaScript basics, DOM manipulation and AJAX.

6. **Rails**: Bring it all together. Learn the core Rails concepts (routing, controllers, models, views). Build a full Airbnb clone in teams and collaborate with GitHub using pull requests.

7. **Projects**: Time to shine! You’ll build and pitch your own product using everything you’ve learned.
