## Background and Objectives

Today we will build a Christmas list, just like you did back in the Intro to Ruby module, but this time **it'll have a real front-end!**

We will be creating a form via which we can upload gifts to our list. We will also be using an [API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to get gift ideas we can add to our list.

The Bootstrap stylesheet is already linked in the `index.html` file for you so feel free to use their pre-made classes or have a go at making your own in `style.css`!

Note: there will be no `rake` for this challenge! To see if your page is working, you'll have to test it out yourself in the browser.

## 1. HTML & CSS

### 1.1. Create a form

![Form and list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/js-reboot/step1.png)

Let's begin by creating our gift form. It should have the following inputs:

1. Name
2. Price

Use a little CSS and/or Bootstrap to make it look neat and center it in the middle of the page. Don't worry about spending too long on this; you can come back to it at the end if you want to make it look prettier üñåÔ∏è

### 1.2. Create list

Let's create a list and two or three hard-coded items. We will remove these shortly so we can add the items via the form; they're just there for now so we can style our list :)

## 2. JavaScript Form

![Dynamic form and list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/js-reboot/step2.gif)

Let's make our form work!

### 2.1. Listen for a submission

At which moment do we want to add an item to our list? When we **submit** our form, of course!

First, select the form. Then, listen out for form submission. For now, we can just `console.log('Form submitted!')` when we hear it.

Note: Remember that the default behaviour of a form is that it refreshes the page unless we tell it not to!

### 2.2. Grab the inputs

Before we start thinking about adding things to the list, let's start off with grabbing the name and price from the form's inputs.

Remember, you first need to select each input and _then_ you can access its value.

To check if you're accessing the right elements, you can use `console.log()` at each stage.

### 2.3. Add information from the inputs to the list

Now that we have the information from the form, lets select our list an add our gift to the **end** of it.

## 3. Fetch and API

Sometimes it's hard to think of gifts for everyone. So, let's use the Fake Store API to come up wiht some ideas! Take a minute to read the [documentation](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) before beginning.

### 3.1. Create a 'find ideas' form

![Find ideas form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/js-reboot/step3.gif)

For our 'ideas' form, we want to have a dropdown with the following options:

- Electronics
- Jewelry
- Men's clothing
- Women's clothing

**Important:** It doesn't matter if you have the text displayed in the options capitalised or not, but the `value` of each one _must_ be written the same as they are [here](https://fakestoreapi.com/products/categories)

Follow the same steps as you did for your previous form (HTML, basic CSS and listening out for a submission).

### 3.2. On submit, call the API

We will be making a `fetch` request to make a call to the API.

As there is an endpoint for each category, we will want to make sure that we can access any endpoint using the same code.

Below is some code to get you started. Don't forget that you first need to grab the user's chosen category from the input!

Below is some code that makes a call to the endpoint for the "jewelery" category. You can use this as a starting point to help you figure out how to dyanmically make calls to the API depending on the user's selected category.

```
fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products/category/jewelery')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => console.log(data))
```

Use `console.log()` to see what we got back from the API.

### 3.3. Display gift ideas in a list

![Display gift ideas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/js-reboot/step4.gif)

Look carefully at what the API has given you - which information is relevant to our list? How do we access it?

Let's display the gift options in a separate list so the user can see which choices are available to them.

In a moment we'll want to make it so that we can select ideas and add them to our main list, so you can go ahead and create an "Add" button for each one.

### 3.4. Choose on an idea and add it to the list

![Select gift ideas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/js-reboot/step5.gif)

Now, when a click is heard on the "Add" button of each idea, let's remove that item from the ideas list and add it the main gift list.

## Optionals

### Click on an item to cross it out

![Select gift ideas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/js-reboot/step6.gif)

Already bought a gift? Great! So let's cross it off on our list.

For both the items we add via our form and also the ones that come from our ideas list, listen out for a click. Upon clicking, we want to cross the item off.

ü§î Bonus: Can you make it so that when we hover over an item, the mouse turns to a üëÜüèΩ?

### Save the list

Notice how when we refresh the page, we lose the items we added to our list. Can you store the items in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) as we add them and load them up when we refresh?

### Improve it with JS packages

Have a go at implementing [Tom Select](https://tom-select.js.org/) to improve the appearance of the dropdown list.
